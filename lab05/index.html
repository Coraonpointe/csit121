            <p>This is a webpage I created in my CSIT 121 class. I have been learning about coding in the html form.
                It has been more facinating then overwhelming. Learning this language broken into smaller steps has
                helped me
                to understand html better. I have been wanting to learn this concept for a while now and I'm excited to
                be finally
                learning it.</p>

            <p>This week we learned about CSS which stands for Cascding Style Sheets. This is the way
                that HTML gets style added to the page so it makes it more visually appealing to viewers
                of the website. I had a hard time figuring out how to
                make a clickable link a different color but after some reasearch I figured it
                out. </p>

                <li>Basic CSS text </li>

            <h2>Lab 5</h2>
            <p><i>Published on March 26, 2025 by Cora Higgins</i></p>


            <p>This week we learned about layout responsiveness and how we can accomplish that with float, flex box,
                grid
                and media queries. This was a very challenging lesson for me and a lot for me to grasp, process and
                apply.
                This lab took me so long and I had to look back at the class recordings to understand these concepts
                more.
                I got frustrated dring the process of figuring it out and learning how to apply what we had learned. But
                I didn't give up and I figured it out. </p>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Flex Box
                <li>Media Queries</li>
                <li>Creating Columns</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This was a helpful link for learning about media queries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Media_queries">Click
                        for learning about media queries</a></li>
            </ul>
