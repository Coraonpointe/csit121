            <p>This is a webpage I created in my CSIT 121 class. I have been learning about coding in the html form. 
                It has been more facinating then overwhelming. Learning this language broken into smaller steps has helped me
            to understand html better. I have been wanting to learn this concept for a while now and I'm excited to be finally
        learning it.</p>

                <p>This week we learned about CSS which stands for Cascding Style Sheets. This is the way
                    that HTML gets style added to the page so it makes it more visually appealing to viewers
                of the website. I had a hard time figuring out how to 
            make a clickable link a different color but after some reasearch I figured it
        out.  </p>
