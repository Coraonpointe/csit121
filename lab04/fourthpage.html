        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>I chose this GIF because this is a well know art piece. I enjoyed the way this photo showed the detail and texture of the art
            piece. It's difficult to notice the texture and full detail of an art piece unless you look very closely and take the time to 
            view the piece with great attention. This animation zooms in very closely so you can pay attention to the detail since that is 
            a very important part of art and art viewing.
