        <h2>Art & Photography</h2>
        <p>These pages contain pictures of photography and art. The photography is taken by me and the art was not done by me.
        Art is something I love to create is many different forms. Photography is one of those forms. I hope you enjoy the photography and the detail of 
    art displayed. </p>
