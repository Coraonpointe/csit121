        <p>This is a photograph I took with my newer Canon camera. I really enjoy this photo!
            I took this photo at a nature center at Bethany Beach, Delaware. This photo is a jpg. This photo reminds me of the peaceful
            time I had walking in nature outside. I like how the flowers are right next to each other.
