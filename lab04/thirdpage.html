        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>This is a photo I took on my 2003 Canon Camera. This was taken on Bethany Beach, Delaware. I picked this photo because it is a png and it is one of my favorite photos I've taken. I recently entered it into a 
            photo contest and I was a finalist in the contest! I'm very proud of this photo!
