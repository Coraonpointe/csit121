    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        This lab was not the hardest lab since 
        it incoorporated some of the basic concepts we have 
        learned so far. It was fun to learn how to code tables and forms.
        I felt like it definitely was one of the easier concepts to learn 
        and apply. The tables were very easy to understand but the forms took
        a little more time to figure out. I had to revisit the lesson for guidance
        on the forms. I enjoyed the ease of this lab and I had fun styling it!
