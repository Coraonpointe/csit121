        <p>What is the URL of the website?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.baltimorefilm.com/">https://www.baltimorefilm.com/</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the name of the website?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Baltimore Film Office</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Who is the site's target audience?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People who enjoy locally filmed tv shows and movies. Actors who are 
                looking to be in a local film. Screenwriters and directors 
                who would like to use the Baltimore area to film.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How is the site organized?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Webbed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which CRAP Design Principle does this use? 
        Provide at least one example.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This site uses proximity. In the different pages that are linked 
                and named on the navigational bar there are things that are related 
                and are grouped together in a way that makes sense. This makes it easy
                 to find what you’re looking for when it’s well organized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the Audit Score according 
        to the Accessibility Checker</p>
        <ul>
            <li>48%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the site's effectiveness?
         Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The font size is definitely too small and is hard to read. This makes 
                it hard for people to know where the buttons are going to take them to 
                and what information is on the page. This can make it hard for people who
                 can’t see very well or people who have dyslexia or have a hard time reading 
                 to be able to use this site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the site's efficiency? 
        Can users perform tasks quickly?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the content is small on the page and close together you don’t have to 
                go very far to get from button to button. The links are different colors so it’s
                 easy to see them and utilize them. The font size definitely slows down the process
                  of finding and reading content on the page to find out what it says and where it’s 
                  going to take you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate 
        for its industry/topic?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes, it is relevant to its industry. It provides helpful resources and contacts that 
                could help actors, directors, screenwriters and more. Again, the content and font are 
                way too small and it’s not pleasant in that way. The buttons do lead to the correct links
                 and content, all except the social media buttons at the bottom. They are outdated and the
                  Facebook link doesn’t lead to the right site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make at least one recommendation to improve this
         website based on what you learned in this module. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I would improve this website by making it accessible for people with disabilities to 
                navigate. Making it bigger to see and to use the buttons easier will make it easier for
                 people who can’t read well or see well to be able to navigate this site.</li>
        </ul>
