<h2>Importance</h2>
<p>TTML is very important. It helps to make videos more accessable to all people.
 Captions are what makes it possible for people who are deaf to be able to experience
 what they are watching. This provides the dialogue from the video showing up and the 
 sounds, actions and anything else that could explain what is happening coming on their
 screen.</p>
 <p>Subtitles are for people who speak another language and can't understand the 
    language being spoken so they can change the dialogue to their language to understand
    it better. Subtitles and captions can also help people who have a hard time processing
    the words being spoken and the actions happening so they understand better and enjoy 
    what they are watching more. TTML files are used regularly to help make it possible 
for people to engage in the content they are viewing. Many streaming services and video
applications utilize TTML files.</p>
<p>
    TTML can help with multiple languages captions on the screen at once. This can be 
    helpful if people with multiple languages are watching something. The coding would
    have to be done so it would be smaller text or less text on a line so it can fit on 
    the screen. The file would idealy be burned into the video so there would be
    less issues. This web standard defintely does a good job creating a way for more
    accessablity.
