            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am 22 years old. I am coming back to CCBC to finish my associates degree after 4 years since graduating high school and attending CCBC in high school. 
                I like to work with technology! I like to help people troubleshoot technology and I'm excited when I can help someone and figure something out. 
                I'm looking forward to learning more in depth about technology so I can efficiently help more people and get a good job in the IT field.
