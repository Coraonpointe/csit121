        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Through this lesson I was able to recall all I learned in this course about HTML and CSS.
            It gave me the chance to compile all I learned in one website. I enjoyed revisiting my previous
            labs and seeing how much I have improved since the beginning of this course. As I was creating this website
            I was able to code a lot easier than in the beginning of this course. To start I made an outline of the
            content
            and it was easier to know where everything was going to go. This final project was a great way
            to wrap up this course and showcase what we have learned. </p>
        <p>When I tested the website on two desktops and a phone it was nice to see that the web design did change.
            On the desktops it had more of a wider area to spread out. On the phone it was more of a vertical
            design. When designing this website and was struggling to remember the exact order to create a table. I
            looked
            at one of my previous labs and was able to figure it out. I had the correct tags but they weren't in quite
            the correct
            order. I enjoyed creating this website and I am happy I now have a portfolio of my website design that I can
            share with
            others and I can add to my resume. Below are the links to all my labs from this course.</p>
