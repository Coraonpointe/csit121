        <h2>Lab 3: CSS Basics</h2>
        <img src="lab03.png" alt="Basic website design" width="1000">
        <p>This lab was one of first few websites I created. For this lab we were learning
            and implementing CSS for the first time in this course. It was nice to be able to 
            add color and a better design to my website to liven it up. CSS is a big part of 
            helping the website look appealing. This was a very important less for web design.

        <h2>Lab 4: Visual Media Lab</h2>
        <img src="lab04.png" alt="Basic website design" width="1000">
        <p>This lab was one of my favorites. For this lab we were learning how to make a multi
            page website and add images to our website. This one was challenging getting the 
        image sizes right. I liked this lab since I got to add some of my own photography.</p>
