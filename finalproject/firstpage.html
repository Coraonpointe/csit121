        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Cora! I'm an IT major at the Community College of Baltimore County. 
            I have a love for tech and being able to help people work with and 
            understand their technology. I have many other interests such as audio visual technology,
             dance, choreography, art, acting and I'm a film nerd. This website is a portfolio for my Web 
             Standards class and it showcases what I learned by completing this course.
        </p>
        <h2>What I learned in CSIT 121</h2>
        <p>Through this course I have learned that I love coding! Web design is a career I
            would like to pursue. I have enjoyed creating websites and adding design to them. I'm
            an artist and it was fun to be able to incoorporate that into this class and in the 
            websites I've built. I've learned that building a website takes hard work and it takes 
            a while and can't be left to the last minute to quickly whip up. I'm glad I took this 
            class and I'm excited to use what I learned in my career!
        </p>
