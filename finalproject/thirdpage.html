        <h2>Lab 7: Table and Form Lab</h2>
        <img src="lab07.png" alt="Basic website design" width="1000">
        <p>For this lab we were learning how to create a table and a form in HTML 
            and designing them in CSS. This lab was fun since we were able to add our own
            personalization. This website has two pages and was desgined with one CSS document. 
        </p>
        <h2>Lab 9: XML</h2>
        <img src="lab09.png" alt="Basic website design" width="1000">
        <p>For this lab we didn't have to do much coding since we used an example from a website. 
            This lab was about XML and how it works with HTML to store information that is retrieved
            by the JavaScript in the HTML. This lab required some troubleshooting but I did figure it out.
